A theme originally created by [Wimer Hazenberg](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/), who had this to say about it:

> It’s very pleasing to the eyes, yes? And colorful too. Ooooooooh, it’s such a pleasure to work in this warm and friendly environment.

Monokai's bright, saturated colours nevertheless manage to be very easy on the eyes.
